This growth reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.3% from 2024 to 2030. Several key factors are driving this expansion:1. **Demand for Lightweight and Fuel-Efficient Systems**: The automotive industry is increasingly prioritizing lightweight materials and systems to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, which is positively impacting the steering systems market. 2. **Advancements in Electric Steering Technologies**: The growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and their need for efficient, responsive, and lightweight steering systems are contributing to the growth of electric power steering (EPS) systems, which offer better fuel efficiency and a more precise driving experience.3. **Adoption of Steer-by-Wire Technology**: Innovations such as steer-by-wire systems are gaining attention due to their ability to remove traditional mechanical linkages, offering advantages in both vehicle design and performance. These systems enhance vehicle safety, reduce weight, and offer more flexible cabin configurations, which is attractive to automotive manufacturers.4. **Sustainability and Regulatory Pressures**: Increasing government regulations regarding fuel efficiency and emissions are pushing the automotive industry towards more sustainable, advanced technologies, including steering systems that support these goals.5. **Rise of Autonomous and Automated Driving**: The market is also benefiting from the increasing push for automated driving systems, which demand more advanced, precise steering technologies. EPS and steer-by-wire systems are particularly well-suited for autonomous vehicles because they allow for more control and customization of the driving experience.These factors, alongside ongoing innovations in steering technologies, position the light automotive steering systems market for sustained growth throughout the forecast period. The market’s expansion will likely be supported by continued technological advancements and a shift toward more sustainable and efficient automotive solutions.</p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Request PDF Sample Copy of Report: (Including Full TOC, List of Tables &amp; Figures, Chart)&nbsp;@&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/89433/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=262" target="_blank">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/89433/&utm_source=github-GC&utm_medium=262</a></strong></strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class="">Direct Gas Flow Anesthesia Machine Market&nbsp;Overview and Projection:</h3><p id="" class="">Using a deliberate segmentation technique, the Direct Gas Flow Anesthesia Machine Market research study provides a comprehensive analysis of multiple market segments, including application, type, and location.
